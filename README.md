# Discord-Bot
A powerful, multipurpose Discord bot programmed using the Discord API and Python 3 that can do tasks such as keep time, respond to messages, organize servers, etc. Created for the DNHS Debate Discord server to automate and ease tasks on Discord as well as give more control over different functions in Discord.

**Note: Original code was written in JavaScript, but later rewritten in Python. Therefore, the "index.js" file is outdated and not used.
        Additionally, the Discord API token listed in this repository is not the same one being used to run the bot (for security
        reasons); it has been regenerated.**

## Passive Abilities
- Returns the name of a member who leaves or joins the server along with a message.

```
Commands list:
!ping - Returns your current device's ping in ms
!8ball + question - Returns your question as well as an answer to it (much like a Magic 8Ball)
!clear # - Clears the inputted number of messages (including the clear statement); defaults to 5 messages without an inputted number
!kick @name#0000 - Kicks the inputted member from the server
!ban @name#0000 - Bans the inputted member from the server
```
