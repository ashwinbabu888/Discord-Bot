# Discord-Bot
A powerful, multipurpose Discord bot programmed using the Discord API and Python 3 that can do tasks such as keep time, respond to messages, organize servers, etc. Created for the DNHS Debate Discord server to automate and ease tasks on Discord as well as give more control over different functions in Discord.

**Note: Original code was written in JavaScript, but later rewritten in Python. Therefore, the "index.js" file is outdated and not used.
        Additionally, the Discord API token listed in this repository is not the same one being used to run the bot (for security
        reasons); it has been regenerated.**

## Abilities
- Can respond to messages by directly pinging a person or replying generally in the channel.
- Can clear a specified amount of messages.
